  title: "Probabilistic modelling for NLP powered by deep learning"
  instructor: Wilker Aziz
  abstract:  "In this lecture I will present probabilistic modelling with neural networks, we will start with maximum likelihood estimation based on fully observed data, then we will discuss the challenges of learning distributions over observed and unobserved (latent) data. We will then talk about variational inference and how it may help us estimate deep generative models."
