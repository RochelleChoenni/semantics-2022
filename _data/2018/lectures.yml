  title: "Variational auto-encoders"
  instructor: Wilker Aziz
  abstract:  "In this lecture I will present generative modelling with neural networks, we will start with a mixture model and then present the variational auto-encoder."
  background:
    - "Variational Inference: "
    - "Chapter 2 of Matthew Beal's [PhD thesis](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf) gives a very clear development of variational inference for Bayesian models."
    - "An outstanding account of variational methods with lots of references to recent developments is given in David Blei's [tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf)."
    - "[Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)"
