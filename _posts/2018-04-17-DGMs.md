Hello everyone,


I've updated the slides of today's lecture to fix a few mistakes and took this chance to also add some of the stuff I presented on the board. Tomorrow we will pick up from where we left (ELBO and the VI objective) and discuss our first deep generative model (the *variational auto-encoder*).

See you there.
